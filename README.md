Vim Configuration
=================

### General

There's nothing really special here, a pretty minimal setup.<br>
mapleader is set to comma (','). All navigation keys has been disabled.

Using vundle to manage plugins.

### Extended C++ Syntax Highlighter

I've extended cpp.vim to highlight functions, namespaces, and STL containers.
This is available in <i>vim/after/syntax/cpp/custom.vim</i>

### Dark Color Theme

My preference has always been a dark theme, and that's precisely how <i>vim/colors/mrtba.vim</i>
is configured. Here's an example:

![mrtba vim theme](https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/dc3559bb6a7ef5f6b55bfff2a23a8076fe64b275/687474703a2f2f7777772e6d72616e646572626572672e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031332f30342f76696d63707073796e2e706e67 "mrtba vim theme")
